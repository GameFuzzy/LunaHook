LunaHook is the Core Text Hook Module For [LunaTranslator](https://github.com/HIllya51/LunaTranslator).

## Download

Download it via the GitHub [release](https://github.com/HIllya51/LunaHook/releases).

For English users, download `Release_English.zip`. For Chinese users, download `Release_Chinese.zip`. For Russian users, download `Release_Russian.zip`.

If you use Windows XP (e.g. to run older visual novels), download the zip file with the `_winxp` suffix.

## Plugins

Download plugin32 or plugin64 from [releases](https://github.com/HIllya51/LunaHook/releases).

The application is compatible with Textractor plugins.

Since both LunaHost32 and LunaHost64 can inject both 32-bit and 64-bit games, you only need to use either of `LunaHost32` and `LunaHost64`, and therefore only need to download either of `plugin32` and `plugin64`.
